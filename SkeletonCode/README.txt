Project1 Skeleton code v1.0

This code is set up for Visual Studio 2005.  I will generate the version for Visual Studio 7
in a bit.

The code files are mostly in the "SoftwareRenderer" directory.  The ".tif" files in this
directory are used in the rendering of the scene.

This README will contain any modifications to the code base as the project moves along.

Project1 Skeleton code v1.01

I set up the project for Visual Studio 2003 (v7) as per the request of some students.
The solution is called MazeViewer7.

Also, the main() argument check was modified to output the name of the program "MazeViewer <file>"
